    "main_text": "Thin School learning is a self-paced, multi-intelligence platform for workforce development focusing on advanced, as well as traditional technologies. Students can choose their own learning style, however, Artificial Intelligence will adapt to their learning pace and method according to their individualized assessment. Students can also connect with multiple peers remotely to discuss, collaborate, and explore new ideas with new learning techniques.<br>Thin School will help anticipate future job requirements and disseminate specialized technological knowledge to the future workforce. Thin School has teamed up with Clemson University�s Center for Workforce Development and their Educate Workforce online portal model. This allows us to institute a blended learning style, which will adapt to each student based on how he or she learns best.",

  "about_us": {
    "title": "<b>Thin School</b> is the future learning",
    "body": "As current junior and high school students prepare to enter the workforce over the next 5 � 10 years, they�re faced with a rapidly changing workplace. If equipped with the necessary skills, this new workforce could take advantage of increasing employment opportunity, as more than 50% of the companies in the US are planning to increase their production by at least 5% in the next five years.<br>In South Carolina, there is a rise in employment opportunities with as much as $5.4 billion in capital investment being infused into the state�s economy in 2013, bringing in 15,000 new jobs, 60% of which are in the manufacturing sector. The current unemployment rate can be brought down significantly if young students are introduced to technical knowledge and skills to take advantage of the boom in job opportunities.<br>Today, current programs for advancing workforce development serve the community in a broad array through Career Development Centers, Technical Colleges, and Government Work Force resources. Unfortunately, there is not a collective set of resources that brings together the elements of lifelong learning skills as well as preparing the future workforce of 6th -12th graders. <br>Exposing young students to project/problem-based learning at an early age will create a fertile ground from which future employers can harvest. Thin School will sustain its mission into the future by incorporating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to adapt to the learning style of each individual student. This method will allow the delivery of content that aligns with the student�s learning preferences, allowing for deeper comprehension.<br>By maintaining a comprehensive portfolio of expertise, resources, and services readily available to their partners, Thin School�s strategies will eventually result in narrowing of the gap between the rich and poor within the community and be a catalyst for holistic community development."
